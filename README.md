Hi, I'm Trinity (@trinitylleigh)! 
I'm interested in software building and cybersecurity. I'm currently growing my skills in HTML, CSS, and Javascript, and have begun learning more about Python. 
My projects include personal projects and projects done in collaboration with various Girls Who Code programs.
